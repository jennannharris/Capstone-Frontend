                        Many pet parents often find themselves in situations when they are unable
                        to care for thier animals. Maybe someone faces a health challenge and they
                        can no longer do the physical work of taking care of the pets. 
                        Perhaps a person faces some financial difficulties and can’t afford the 
                        pets’ food, medicines or veterinary care. Sadly, a lot of animals get left
                        behind and are sent to shelters where, especially if the animal is a senior,
                        they might not ever have a home again. The beloved pet is often overlooked
                        in the situation of it’s owner passing away and the animal is left greiving and
                        confused about why they’ve just been taken out of thier home.

                        It doesn’t have to be this way. Family Finder is a website dedicated to the
                        rehoming of animals so they can continue to live healthy, happy lives.
